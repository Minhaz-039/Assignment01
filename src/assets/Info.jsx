          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Landwind is an open-source library of interactive components built
            on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons, dropdowns, modals,
            navbars, and more.

            Landwind is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma
            software so everything you see in the library has a design
            equivalent in our Figma file.

      question: "What are the differences between Landwind and Tailwind UI?",
      answer: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            The main difference is that the core components from Landwind are
            open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid
            product.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Landwind relies on smaller and standalone components, whereas
            Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
